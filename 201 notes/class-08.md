# CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flex box is one-dimensional, meaning that it only deals with the layout for one dimension at a time. This can be done by adjusting elements by the row or the column. The opposite way of dealing with dimensions in a layout is by applying CSS Gris which is two-dimensional but this can be another discussion.

2. The difference between the main axis and the cross-axis. The cross-axis is reliant on the main axis. For instance, if your CSS Flexbox is laid out in a row (i.e., `flex-direction: row`) this would sit on the x-axis (horizontal axis). The cross axis would the the y-axis or `flex-direction: column`. In other words, the adjacent axis to the content of the main axis is the cross-axis.

3. Certain properties used for CS Flexbox can throw off the flow of the content on a webpage if not careful. For instance, using a a property of `flex-direction` with `row-reverse` can make the content within that element display in an opposing order to how its laid out in your HTML document.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. Before CSS flexbox, the most common positioning tool in CSS was the `float` property. When CSS Flexbox was introduced, it created a more dynamic way to custimize the way your content can be laid out in the browser without causing a disruption to the rest of the content on the webpage. By putting content inside of "boxes", it allows for a package of content to move more freely in the page within its own container. the float property does not hold its elements in a container and this can cause some difficult and buggy layout issues. 

2. This topic connects with my long-term goals because it informas me of the tools I can use to make my coding experience a little more simplified in the context of knowing how I can have control over the flow of the content on my webpage.
