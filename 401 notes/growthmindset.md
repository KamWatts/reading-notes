# The Growth Mindset

## What is the growth mindset? Why is it important?

Having a growth mindset means having a drive to continually put yourself in a situation that teaches you a new skillset or drills down a difficult probelm until it is no longer difficult.

Your growth mindset can be built through deliberate practice. Deliberate practice is the task of bringing you out of your comfort zone to bring your mental capabilities beyond its limits. Every formed a headache after learning a new task? That feeling of needing sleep at the end of a mentally taxing day at school? This means you experienced some growth.

Practice to get better by gaining new skills or not shying away from new challenges. Overtime, this can build confidence and if having a growth mindset becomes a habit, then it becomes a part of your lifestyle which means you constantly have a goal to reach.

## Betting on Yourself

Recognize your reaction to facing new challenges.

Do you welcome it? Or do you get angry about it?

How do you channel those feelings?

Believing in yourself can lead you to solve a lot more challenges. Embracing the feeling of being uncomfortable is extremely valuable. Do not be afraid to fail. Failure is the best teacher because with each failure is a new lesson learned. Failure is the only gainfully employed teacher that sticks with you for your entire life and it should be cherished just as much as your success.

## Trust the Process

Focus and preserverence is what builds resilience. Are you naturally good at everything you try? If so, you are one in a million. Your consistency is what lines your path with the bricks you need to walk on that will lead you to the end-goal.

Your mind and thought procceses are trained by intuition. To gain stronger intuition means to be exposed to more and more concepts that require your problem solving and critical thinking skills. This is a muscle that can be grown. Building this muscle will result in faster answers to problems because of your exposure to different concepts that your brain recognizes from experience.

## Know your "Why"

Let your passion drive you to new heights in your growth mindset journey. Passion and grit can outpower natural ability any day of the week. Why is this? Passion drives consistency. Do you just stop doing something you love? Something you have a connection to? The usual answer to this question is "No".

Constantly putting in the work is what makes the difference in ability. This drive to be greater and sticking with it, having the "stamina" to stick it through no matter what challenges you face is known as "Grit".

Work ethic and motivation outperforms talent on a large scale. grit is usually unrelated to talent and is closely related to the growth mindset of the individual that challenges themselves with pure effort in response to challenges. The person with grit may face more challenges than a naturally gifted person at the same type of event and in turn, this means they are more likely to preservere through new hurdles.
