# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML

1. Wrap text inside of a `link` element to create a basic link.

2. The `href` attribute contains the path for the link provided.

3. Ways to ensure a link is accessible to all readers is by creating a path that is global instead of local.

## CSS Layout

1. A normal flow refers to the organization of the code in relation to the organization of the HTML file. For example, the `body` element should be selected before the `p` element because the `body` has precedence and importance of the `p` element.

2. * Block Level - An element that starts a new line. Occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container). According to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)

* Inline Elements - Only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content. [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

  3. `Static` positioning is the deafult position of all elements.

  4. The advantages of `absolute` positioning:
  
* you can easily position your div anywhere you want.

* Only positioned relative to the offset parent.

  5. The key difference between absolute and fixed positioning: 

  - Absolute positioning will adjust in respect to its parent element. If no parent is present then the element will use the document body as the parent.

  - Fixed positioning will cause the element to stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

  ## Learn JS

  - `Declaration` is when you start the creation of a variable in a function.

  - `invocation` is when a piece of code is when a code's vaule is retrieved by calling the function name.

## Benefits of Pair Programming

### Code Quality Improvement

  - Pairing with a second coder to implement code can increase the quality of the output. With constructive feedback and a second set of eyes to see what is going on with your code - this can have a very positive effect on the readability and functionality.

  - Pair programming can also improve the workflow of the project. Implementing teamwork - with each contributor having a specific task to handle, this type of delegation ensures that one person is not taking on too many overwhelming tasks at once. This is also a great opportunity to improve your communication skills!
