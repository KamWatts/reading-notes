# Local Storage

1. A developer may consider using local storage in order to access data that was previously closed out. For instance, when you're using a website that takes in user input information, that information needs to be stored locally just in case the user has to close out of the system and come back to finish the form later. Local storage has the advantage of keeping a key on the user's computer with information that can be recognized by the server once that user returns to the app or website they were using.

2. Sensitive data such as social security, address, payment information should not be stored locally. Local storages can be easily compromised. Without the right securities in place, storing sensitive information like this can lead to some very trying times for the user if their information gets hacked.

3. When it comes to local storage, you can only store strings in different keys. Furthermore, if you have an object - it will _NOT_ be stored right away. Local storage saves database information known as **cookies**. Cookies are stored on your local storage and when you visit a website over and over again it can improve the loading speed of said website due to the local storage of cookies pertaining to that website.
