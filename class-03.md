### When should you use an unordered list in HTML?

- An unordered list should be used when the list does not need to be in any particular chronological order.

### How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

- You can use different symbols such as the "*" or "-" characters to represent bullets.

### When should you use an ordered list vs an unordered list in your HTML document?

- When the order of the list is meaningful such as a set of steps and instructions that needs to be followed, is when an ordered list is necessary.

- The unordered list can be used for lists where step-by-step instructions are not needed.
