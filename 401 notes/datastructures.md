# Advancing in Data Structures and Algorithms

## Recursion

Recursion is where a function calls itself. This is a method used in programming to make a solution more clear. When more understanding is needed for readability, recursive techniques are implemented.

When writing a recursive function, you have to tell the recursion when to stop. It takes two cases, the base case, and the recursive case. During the base case is when the function will no longer call itself.

## Are Data Structures and Algorithms really **that** complicated?

What is a data structure?

    - Data that is stored inside of a structure. Also known as `compound data`.  

What is Big O notation?

    - The amount of time it takes for a code to complete. How fast it runs.

What is Linked List?

It has nodes that contains a value and a pointer. The pointer connects you to the next node in the chain. The nodes consist of a head and a tail. Linked Lists are not too good at retrieveing other nodes due to its structure.

What is an array?

    - A continuous block of cells in a computer's memory. Arrays are good for retrieving items but continuously grows inside so adding to an array is not always the most efficient thing to do. This is not too friendly of a concept in lower level langauges.

What is a dictionary?

    - They work like arrays "under the hood"
    - Hash tables are objects in JavaScript. Hashing functions spit out memory locations for you. Depending on the hashing algorithm you use two keys can point to the same location which can cause a potential `collision`.

What is a `stack` or a `queue`?

    - They are similar and built on top of arrays with additional features.
    - Stack: Known as Last in First out data structures (LIFO)
    - Queue: Known as First in First Out (FIFO)

What is `graphs` and `trees`?

    - Nodes that point to other nodes (like arrays). But in this case they have edges.
    - Complicated networks like social media platforms use graphical data structures.
    - Binary search trees - full of nodes that have no more than two children descending from them.
    - BST is not a perfect data structure and can become un-balanced.
