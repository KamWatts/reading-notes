# MongoDB and Mongoose

## Differences: SQL vs NoSQL

1.

- SQL databases are primarily relationational
- NoSQL databases are non-relational

2.

- SQL databases are table-based
- NoSQL databases are document-based

3.

- SQL databases have predefined schema
- NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

4.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable
- NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable

What kind of data is a good fit for a SQL database?

- complex query intensive environments

Give a real-world example

- Oracle, MySwl, Sqlite, Postgres, and MS-SQL

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

- SQL databases are best for this type of storage

Which type of database is best for scalability?

- They both have their own benefits. However, NoSQL databases are horizonatally scalable. More servers can be added to the database infrastructure to handle large traffic.

What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Langauge

What is a relational database?

A database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information

What structure does a relational database work with?

Tables, rows, and columns

What is a 'schema'?

A representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model

What is a NoSQL database?

It's a non-tabular database.

How does it work?

The data is stored in JSON documents instead of columns and rows used in relational databases.

What is inside of a MongoDB database?

BSON documents. Which are collections, gathered together to store documents.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB?

MonogoDB. Because it ensures high and diverse data availability. Also ensures better reliability with transactions.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

The most reviewed drawback in that they do not support ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability). ACID is the process of transactions between multiple documents.
