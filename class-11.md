## Responsive Images

1. Having a responsive image can improve the quality of the images that are displayed across an array of screen sizes. For some screen sizes, the resolution of an image can be reliant on the image size in relation to the pixel count. Having an image that is adjusted to the appropriate size for a screen can also improve the speed at which the webpage loads.

2. `srcset` defines the set of images that the browser can choose between and what size each image will be. `sizes` defines a set of media conditions and indicates what image size would be best to choose when certain media conditions are specified and met.

3. The `srcset` attribute can be more efficient than deploying images through JavaScript or CSS due to the built-in capability it has to adapt a specific-sized image to the screen in relation to the screen size. This decreases th amount of bandwidth that mobile users have to use.
