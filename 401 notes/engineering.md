Yes, you read that twice. Now how do you become an __effective__ problem-solver?

## The art of problem-solving

1. Analyze the problem

    - In order to solve a problem. You actually have to know what the problem is. This takes gaining extra clarification, asking questions, reading the prompt several times over.

2. Map out a plan

    - How will you go forth and conquer without referring to your guidebook? Create a plan on how you will get to the output to your input. Having a guideline in the form of psuedo-code or plain, high-level english can help your brain process how it needs to think in order for you to formulate the best possible solution(s).

3. Solve small problems first

    - Smaller problems can be defined as implementing and tackling parts of the code you already know the answer to and building from this foundation. OR this could mean you don't exactly know how to get to the big-picture answer and need to break down the problem into smaller solutions that guides you to the big picture answer. Do your research for each small problem to get a deeper level understanding about how each step will effect the next step or how it pairs well with the last problem you solves.

4. Revising and refactoring

    - Once the answer has been formulated, it's now time to figure out what you can optimize. Optimization comes in the form of several shapes and sizes. This could mean you can optimize your semantics to better explain what certain functions or variables are doing. This will help with readability and give the impression that you actually know what your code is doing, thus helping the next person that has to refer to your code.
