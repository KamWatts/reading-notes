# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. An object is an item or product that contains different properties or characteristics that makes the object what it is. For instance, a book (object), consists of an author that wrote it, pages of paper, a hard or soft cover, and has a publishing company behind it. These are all the properties that were used to create that object.

2. Advantages of creating object literals is that it makes the code easier to read, and ensures an easier way to identify each item by name.

4. Objects differ from arrays in a sense that objects represent physical things and arrays represent data structures that are stored in a collection. Arrays are mutable and can be modified at any index of the array.

5. `this` refers to the variable of the object. The advantage of using `this` is that it instantly clarifies that the code intends to target the specific object it resides inside of.

## Intro to the DOM

1. The DOM stands for Document Object Model which is in reference to the HTML file. The DOM consist of nodes that span from the elements inside of a HTML file. The nodes can be manipulated with JavaScript and HTML when they are all linked together.

2. JavaScript would not exist for any front-end development if the DOM did not exist. The DOM is independent from JavaScript or any programming language for that matter. JavaScript is used to simply manipulate the DOM.

### Things I would Like to Know

I would like to know how DOM elements tie into the functionality of JavaScript code.
