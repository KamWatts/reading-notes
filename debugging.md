# Debugging

The ideal: To prevent bugs altogether

How do we prevent bugs?

- Breaking down our code into small steps
- Write our code in small steps
- Look for proof of life at each step
- Variable tracking
- rely on our tools - ex. rainbow brackets in VS Code (extension), syntax highlighting
- Plan out code, scafold it out, add comments, make a plan in advance

How do we debug ths bugs out of our code?

- Identify the problem
  - Dev Tools (is there an error message?)
  - By having a second programmer proof read the code
  - Read code line by line as if you are the computer - add comments at each step
  - Take breaks
  - Ask for help (15-minute rule)
  - Comment out all of the code and then comment it in line by line

What's next after the bug is located?

- Is the data type what I expect?
- What variable/functions/methods are only available
