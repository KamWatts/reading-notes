# AWS Lambda

## AWS S3

Amazon S3 stands for Simple Storage Service. This is a cloud-based object storage service. The purpose of S3 is to give devs and businesses  a secure, scalable, and an array of availability to data storage and retreival.

Some use cases for S3 include:

    - Ability to restore data
    - Distributing content (i.e., images and videos)
    - Analytics for big data models

The benefits of using S3 include:

- S3 is well known for its durability
- Automation of deleting specific datasets
- Omtimization of storage costs

## AWS Lambda Basics

AWS Lambda is a compute service that allows the building of apps without server management.

Use cases for AWS Lambda include:

- File processing
- Data and Analytics
- Websites
- Mobile Apps

A "serverless" program is a codebase that relies on a system that is already built. Usually this involves uploading your code into a cloud and letting the cloud manage all of the events that take place behind the scenes that a server would normally do. A good example of this is when you order food on GrubHub it takes away from you having to drive to get your food. You just know what food you want and soon it will be at your door. All of the other underlying factors it took to get to your doorstep was already figured out for you in advance. This is how running your code on the cloud works.

## Content Delivery Network (CDN)

A CDN is a network of servers that essentially work together. It's similar to reception interceptors. Servers that are in different locations around the world makes delivering web content more fast and efficient. This is similar to how Amazon has several networks of servers spanning from North Virginia to Ohio, California, and Oregon. This creates a strong network for AWS content all around the United States.

In relation to how a CDN works with a website visitor, the CDN is accepting requests that the client makes. The CDN is able to check caches, retrieve content from website origin servers, and store copies of data without making future cache requests. The CDN mainly works to reduce load management on a website origin server in the mose efficient way possible.

The benefits of using a CDN include:

- Buiding website performance
- Reduced bandwidth costs
- Better Search Engine Optimization
