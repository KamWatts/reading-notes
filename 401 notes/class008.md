## 5 Steps to Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is a security model to manage and contol access and resources within an organization.

This is important because access is granted based for certain responsibilities on an intranet system based on the role of the individual that wishes to enter the specified database or website. Having limited access within an organization can limit the amount of insider attacks that can happen with so much sensitive information being within reach.

An example of a role/permission heirarchy can scale down from a system administrator to a manager/supervisor, staff, or even contractors.

Based on the role of a person, their responsibilities are either heightened or limited. It is necessary for those who have limited responsibilities within an organization to also have limited access.

To implement an RBAC, a few things need to be looked at:

    - Resources
    - Roles
    - Assignment of roles
    - Enforcement of access controls
    - Monitoring and reviewing

## Wiki - RBAC

If authentication is "you are who you say you are" then authorization is, "this is what you have access to"...

Three primary rules for RBAC is role assignment, role authorization, and permission authorization.

To a non-technical friend, I would explain RBAC in a relatable way. For instance, if you ever had to clock in to work. You may have used a computer where you had to sign in and then either slide your key card, enter an employee number, or scan some type of card, maybe? When you signed in, this may have been the only thing you were authorized to do. However, when your manager signs into the same computer, they have a range of access to see how many hours you worked that week, a weekly schedule, or a backlog of other employee data. All the stuff you could not see! This is an example of RBAC. Based on the role you play at a company determines the type of technological access you are given to explore the data within that company for specific use cases.

## RBAC Tutorial

Access rights are associated with the role of a user. Each role is defined with a specific set of permissions that a user has been assigned.

Access rights and authorization is activated after a user successfuly authenticates their identity. RBAC helps business improve their security, simplfiy their administration, improve complaince, and increased productivity.
