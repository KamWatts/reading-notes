# Images, Color Text

## HTML Media

1. A real world use case for the `<alt>` attribute allows a screen reader to voice a description of the photo. This is a very useful feature visually impaired individuals.
Also, some browsers are text-only and do not display images, thus making the `<alt>` attribute useful in this case.

2. Ways to improve accessibilities of images in an HTML document is to make sure the photo is a perfect contrast of tones and colors in conjuction with the theme of the website. This makes the image easier to pick out and allows a person with poor vision to distiguish the photo from the rest of the webpage. Another thing to keep in mind is to avoid flickering image. Strobe-like effects in images can induce a seizures on those who suffer from epilepsy.

3. The `<figure>` tag are used for content with self-containing information. The `<figure>` tag does not disrupt the main flow of the rest of the content on the page because it is linked in with the main flow of the page.

4. The difference between a GIF and an SVG is that a GIF is an animated photograph or video content in a compressed format. An SVG is drawn out with code by calling drawing commands.

5. The image type I would use to display an image on my website the PNG file type. A PNG file is compressed with more reproduction - meaning that the quality does not diminish and is more transparent in any browser that supports its file type. This will also improve the loading speed of images on the webpage as a result of a smaller file size.

1. Foreground vs Background colors:

- Background - the wall paper of the webpage. This color remains consistent as the backdrop. It can be compared to the wall you may hang pictures on or mount a TV to.

- Foreground - everything that displays in front of the background. Foreground colors can be the font color of the text on the screen, border colors, hover colors, logos.

2. I would use color to give a colorless blog some character by outlining a color swatch pattern first. Make sure a family of different shades of colors actually pair well together to give a professional contrasting appearance to the website so its desirable for the user to look at and interact with.

3. Things to consider when choosing a font is the browser compatibility. If the heading font should be different from the rest of the body font, to make it stand out, spacing between the characters, and the color of the font. It is also best practice to set some "fallback fonts" just in case the primary font is not supported.

4. What does font-size, weight, and style do to HTML text elements?

- Font size changes the height of the font. font weight changes how bold or thin the font will be. and font style will determine if the font will be regular, italic, or bold at default.

5. The `letter-spacing` selector in CSS can be applied to any element and given a desired value of a given metric for each character of a word to be separated by. The same goes for the `word-spacing` selector except that it applies for whole words instead of individual characters.
